There is one configuration file per wrapper included with angsd-wrapper, as well as a common configuration file (Common_Config) that can be used by multiple wrappers. FOr this example, we will confgiure ANGSD-wrapper to analyse the Zea mays subsp. mays samples. All of these are located in the Configuration_Files directory; we recommend copying this directory to another directory so that there is always a clean copy of the configuration files available.

                cp -r ~/ECL243/Assignment3/angsd-wrapper/Configuration_Files/ .
