What sequencing depth is your alignment?
- 

Why did so few reads map?
- Only chromosome 10 was provided as a reference

How are the summary stats different?
- Z. mex had 1470419 reads mapped (54.96%) 
- Z. mays had 88127 reads mapped (15.53%)
- 
- 

What might be an explanaton for any differences?
- species divergence
- only small .fq files provided, more reads might yield better coverage

Challenge:

Do you get more or fewer SNPs than you expected? Any idea why?
