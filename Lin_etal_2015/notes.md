Discussion questions to guide reading:
- Why did they conclude there are ~36k genes in ~1.Gb genome?
- How did they perform annotations?
- What are the Symbiodinium-specific gene families?
- What is the evidence presented for each of the following: 
      - retrotransposition
      - gene family expansion
      - no whole-genome duplication
      - sexual reproduction
      - cyst formation
      - microRNA for gene expression regulation in coral and symbiont
      - host-symbiont co-evolution
